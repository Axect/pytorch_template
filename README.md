# PyTorch Template Project

This project provides a flexible template for PyTorch-based machine learning experiments.
It includes configuration management, logging with Weights & Biases (wandb), hyperparameter optimization with Optuna, and a modular structure for easy customization and experimentation.

## Project Structure

- `config.py`: Defines the `RunConfig` and `OptimizeConfig` classes for managing experiment configurations and optimization settings.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, handling command-line arguments and experiment execution.
- `model.py`: Contains the model architecture (currently an MLP).
- `util.py`: Utility functions for data loading, device selection, training, and analysis.
- `run_template.yaml`: Template for run configuration.
- `optimize_template.yaml`: Template for optimization configuration.
- `analyze.py`: Script for analyzing completed runs and optimizations, utilizing functions from `util.py`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytorch_template.git
   cd pytorch_template
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   # Use pip
   pip install torch wandb survey polars numpy optuna matplotlib scienceplots

   # Or Use uv with sync requirements.txt (recommended)
   uv pip sync requirements.txt

   # Or Use uv (fresh install)
   uv pip install -U torch wandb survey polars numpy optuna matplotlib scienceplots
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up a Weights & Biases account for experiment tracking.

## Usage

1. Configure your experiment by modifying `run_template.yaml` or creating a new YAML file based on it.

2. (Optional) Configure hyperparameter optimization by modifying `optimize_template.yaml` or creating a new YAML file based on it.

3. Run the experiment:
   ```sh
   python main.py --run_config path/to/run_config.yaml [--optimize_config path/to/optimize_config.yaml]
   ```

   If `--optimize_config` is provided, the script will perform hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.

4. Analyze the results:
   ```sh
   python analyze.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Run Configuration (`run_template.yaml`)

- `project`: Project name for wandb logging
- `device`: Device to run on (e.g., 'cpu', 'cuda:0')
- `net`: Model class to use
- `optimizer`: Optimizer class
- `scheduler`: Learning rate scheduler class
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training
- `seeds`: List of random seeds for multiple runs
- `net_config`: Model-specific configuration
- `optimizer_config`: Optimizer-specific configuration
- `scheduler_config`: Scheduler-specific configuration

### Optimization Configuration (`optimize_template.yaml`)

- `study_name`: Name of the optimization study
- `trials`: Number of optimization trials
- `seed`: Random seed for optimization
- `metric`: Metric to optimize
- `direction`: Direction of optimization ('minimize' or 'maximize')
- `sampler`: Optuna sampler configuration
- `pruner`: (Optional) Optuna pruner configuration
- `search_space`: Definition of the hyperparameter search space

## Customization

- Modify the `MLP` class in `model.py` or add new model architectures.
- Adjust the `load_data` function in `util.py` to work with your dataset.
- Extend the `RunConfig` and `OptimizeConfig` classes in `config.py` to include additional parameters.

## Features

- Configurable experiments using YAML files
- Integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
- Support for multiple random seeds
- Flexible model architecture (currently MLP)
- Device selection (CPU/CUDA)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Analysis tools for completed runs and optimizations

## Analysis

The `analyze.py` script utilizes functions from `util.py` to analyze completed runs and optimizations. Key functions include:

- `select_group`: Select a run group for analysis
- `select_seed`: Select a specific seed from a run group
- `select_device`: Choose a device for analysis
- `load_model`: Load a trained model and its configuration
- `load_study`: Load an Optuna study
- `load_best_model`: Load the best model from an optimization study

These functions are defined in `util.py` and used within `analyze.py`.

To use the analysis tools:

1. Run the `analyze.py` script:
   ```
   python analyze.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to select the project, run group, and seed (if applicable).

3. The script will load the selected model and perform basic analysis, such as calculating the validation loss.

4. You can extend the `main()` function in `analyze.py` to add custom analysis as needed, utilizing the utility functions from `util.py`.
